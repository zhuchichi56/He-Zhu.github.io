This is an report on the AI algorithm used in Reversed Reversi. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies and complexities involved in this exciting board game. It covers the use of adversarial search algorithms, such as **Min-Max Search and α − β pruning algorithm** to find optimal policies in Reversed Reversi. It utilize some enforcement Learning like **MCST** to compare with the adversarial search algorithms.

The report also discusses how various strategies, such as Mobility and Stable Discs, were hypothesized to impact win rates and were tested accordingly. This provides valuable insights into the game and can help players improve their skills.

The search function used in the AI algorithm is the basic 4-depth α-β pruning, which was chosen as the final search function after considering that the search depth is not necessarily better when it is greater. The report also highlights that parameter settings need to match the search depth, which is an important consideration for anyone developing an AI algorithm for this game.

Overall, this project can help cultivate thinking ability and coding skills using Python. It can train coding ability and help review data structure and algorithm learning from previous classes. Additionally, it provides insights into code optimization and game theory that will be useful for future study and research life.

In conclusion, this report is a great resource for anyone interested in learning more about Reversed Reversi or AI algorithms in general. It provides valuable insights into the AI algorithm used in this game and highlights various strategies that can impact win rates.
