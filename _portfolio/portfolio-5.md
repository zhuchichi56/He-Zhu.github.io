LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) is a compiler infras- tructure that was developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It was created to provide a modern, portable, and highly optimized compiler infrastructure that can be used to develop compilers, programming tools, and other utilities. LLVM was first released in 2003, and has since become a popular choice for compiler development due to its modular design and extensive optimization capabilities. LLVM is written in C++ and is designed to be used as a library, allowing developers to easily incorporate LLVMâ€™s capabilities into their own programs. In this article, we will look at the original design of LLVM and see what is clever about llvm compared to a highly integrated compiler like GCC from a system design perspective.
