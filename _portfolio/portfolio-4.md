​    This report on the AI algorithm in Reversed Reversi provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies and complexities involved in this exciting board game. The paper covers the use of adversarial search algorithms, such as **Min-Max Search and α − β pruning algorithm**, to find optimal policies in Reversed Reversi. The report also discusses how various strategies, such as Mobility and Stable Discs, were hypothesized to impact win rates and were tested accordingly.

​     The search function used in the AI algorithm is the basic 4-depth a-b pruning, which was chosen as the final search function after considering that the search depth is not necessarily better when it is greater. The report also highlights that parameters settings need to match the search depth.  Overall, this project can help cultivate thinking ability and coding skills using Python. It can train coding ability and help review data structure and algorithm learning from previous classes. Additionally, it provides insights into code optimization and game theory that will be useful for future study and research life. 

​     In conclusion, this report provides valuable insights into the AI algorithm used in Reversed Reversi. It highlights various strategies that can impact win rates and discusses how to choose an optimal search function for this game. This paper is a great resource for anyone interested in learning more about Reversed Reversi or AI algorithms in general.
