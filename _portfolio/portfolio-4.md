This is an excellent study that **sheds light on what makes certain words difficult to guess in the Wordle game.** By proposing a new attribute called "Wordle Word Perplexity" and using simulated annealing to find its weight, the authors have shown that players can improve their performance in the game by considering various attributes of words.

One of the key findings of this study is that "Wordle Word Perplexity" is an effective attribute for measuring a word's difficulty in the game. This attribute takes into account not only how frequently a word appears but also how similar it is to other words in terms of letter usage and frequency. By considering these factors, players can better predict which words are more likely to appear in the game and increase their chances of guessing correctly.

Another important contribution of this study is its use of simulated annealing to find the weight for "Wordle Word Perplexity". Simulated annealing is a powerful optimization technique that can be used to find optimal solutions for complex problems. In this case, it was used to find an optimal weight for "Wordle Word Perplexity" that maximizes its effectiveness in predicting difficult words.

Overall, this study has important implications not only for players looking to improve their performance in Wordle but also for researchers interested in studying language and vocabulary acquisition. By analyzing various attributes of words, including their frequency, repeated letter times, and similarity with other words, we can gain a better understanding of how language works and how we can use this knowledge to improve our ability to communicate.

In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into what makes certain words difficult to guess in the Wordle game. By proposing a new attribute and using simulated annealing to find its weight, the authors have shown that players can improve their performance in the game by considering various attributes of words. This research has implications not only for Wordle but also for other word-guessing games and for our understanding of language and vocabulary acquisition.
