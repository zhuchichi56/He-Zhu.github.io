​     This paper explores the application of simulated annealing algorithm in solving the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), which is a challenging problem in the field of artificial intelligence. The CARP involves finding an optimal route for a fleet of vehicles to service a set of required edges (tasks) while respecting capacity constraints and minimizing costs. 

​     The **simulated annealing algorithm** is a heuristic approach that mimics the process of annealing in metallurgy, where a material is heated and then slowly cooled to achieve a desired structure. In this algorithm, an initial solution is randomly generated and then iteratively improved by accepting or rejecting new solutions based on a probability function that depends on the current temperature. This allows the algorithm to escape local optima and explore the search space more effectively. The results of this study show that simulated annealing can be an effective approach for solving the CARP, especially when combined with other techniques such as path-scanning. The main factor that influences the final result is found to be the process of simulated annealing, which has the potential to turn worse initial solutions into better final solutions. However, it should be noted that the initial solution sets a lower limit on the final result. 

​     Overall, this paper provides valuable insights into how simulated annealing can be used to solve complex optimization problems such as CARP, and highlights some important considerations for designing effective algorithms in this field.
