excerpt: 'This paper propose a pre-trained trajectory prediction model via meta-learning, which not only can learn a more generalized initialization parameters to extract the trajectory features of multiple individuals, but also solve the problem of in-homogeneous distribution using pre-trained grid-based classification.'
