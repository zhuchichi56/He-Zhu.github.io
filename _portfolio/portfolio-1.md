​     We trained and built a human following and behavior detection system using Pytorch , Flask, Repberry Pi, Yolo5, openCV. The system can collect pedestrian movement data through cameras and sensors, interact with the backend through the network, and give real-time feedback

​    We independently collected and built a dataset of 10 scenarios (about 21,000 frames) of pedestrian falls and impacts under different locations for training and testing the model of temporal action behavior

​    We characterized pedestrians into 7 points (head, limbs, torso), reproduced and modified the **T-GCN** Model for action behavior prediction and classification, and achieved excellent results in related papers, which was recognized by Prof. NUS for innovation.
